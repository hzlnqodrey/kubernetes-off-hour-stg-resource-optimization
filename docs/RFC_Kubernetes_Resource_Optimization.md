# RFC: Kubernetes Off Hours Staging Resource Optimization

**RFC Number:** 001  
**Title:** Kubernetes Off Hours Staging Resource Optimization  
**Status:** Draft  
**Author:** DevOps Team  
**Created:** 2024-12-01  
**Updated:** 2024-12-01  

## Summary

This RFC proposes implementing an automated Kubernetes resource optimization system using kube-green operator to reduce staging environment costs by 60-80% during off-hours while maintaining seamless developer experience through GitOps workflows and Slack integration.

## Motivation

### Current State

Our staging Kubernetes clusters consume significant resources 24/7, even during off-hours when no active development occurs. This results in:

- **High Infrastructure Costs**: Continuous resource allocation in non-production environments
- **Resource Waste**: CPU, memory, and storage utilization drops to near-zero during evenings and weekends
- **Manual Overhead**: Current resource management requires constant human intervention
- **Inconsistent Practices**: Teams manually scale resources with varying success and reliability
- **Environmental Impact**: Unnecessary carbon footprint from idle infrastructure

### Business Impact

**Current Cost Analysis:**
- Staging environment operational costs: $15,000/month
- Peak utilization hours: 8 AM - 6 PM weekdays (50 hours/week)
- Off-hours: 6 PM - 8 AM weekdays + weekends (118 hours/week)
- Current off-hours utilization: <5%
- Estimated monthly waste: $10,500 (70% of staging costs)

**Proposed Solution Benefits:**
- **Cost Reduction**: 60-80% savings during off-hours
- **Developer Experience**: Zero-friction automated scaling
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduced manual intervention
- **Environmental Impact**: Significant carbon footprint reduction
- **Scalability**: Foundation for multi-environment optimization

### Component Specifications

#### 1. kube-green Operator
- **Technology**: [kube-green v0.5.1](https://github.com/kube-green/kube-green)
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes operator with CRD-based configuration
- **Scheduling**: Cron-based time triggers for sleep/wake operations
- **Scope**: Namespace-aware with configurable resource targeting

#### 2. Resource Optimization Strategy

**Time-Based Scheduling:**
```yaml
# Weekday Schedule
weekdaysSleepAt: "18:00"    # 6 PM
weekdaysWakeUpAt: "08:00"   # 8 AM
# Savings: 14 hours/day = 58% daily reduction

# Weekend Schedule  
weekendsSleepAt: "18:00"    # Friday 6 PM
weekendsWakeUpAt: "08:00"   # Monday 8 AM
# Savings: 62 hours = 100% weekend reduction
```

**Tiered Resource Management:**
1. **Background Services** (Priority 1): Sleep at 18:00
   - Workers, schedulers, batch processors
2. **Web Services** (Priority 2): Sleep at 19:00
   - Frontend, API, web servers
3. **Data Services** (Priority 3): Sleep at 20:00
   - Cache, search, analytics (databases excluded)

#### 3. Slack Integration Service

**Technology Stack:**
- **Language**: Go/Python microservice
- **API Integration**: Slack Bolt SDK
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes Deployment with 3 replicas

**Capabilities:**
- Interactive slash commands (`/k8s-wake`, `/k8s-sleep`, `/k8s-status`)
- Real-time notifications for state changes
- Manual override buttons with confirmation flows
- User permission management and audit logging

#### 4. GitOps Integration

**Workflow:**
```
Manual Override → Slack Service → GitLab API → Repository Update →
